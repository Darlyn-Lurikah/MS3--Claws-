## Automated testing 
Automated testing for HTML and CSS was carried out via W3C Markup and CSS validators.

#### CSS
Used [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) for my css validator and it returned with errors and warnings [here]((static/readme-files/W3C_CSS_validator.pdf)) I found out to be a possible bug after some research 

#### HTML
Used [W3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for html and it retured with errors due to not picking up the Jinja syntax and some test files I had yet to delete that we're missing an image source. See here [](static/readme-files/W3_html_validator.pdf)

#### JAVASCRIPT
Used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) for Javascript and it retured with one error from the cloudinary image upload widget I utilised [here](static/readme-files/JSHint_validator.png). I was unable to rectify this as my image upload no longer worked when I attempted to. 


## Manual testing 

### User story

To test my user story members of my family used my website and they could:

- Register 
- Login 
- Logout 
- Customise profile
- Update profile
- Create a post 
- See their post in their profile page
- Edit their post 
- Delete their post
- Delete thier account 

All were happy with the simplicity of the naviagation and felt it to be intuitive.
